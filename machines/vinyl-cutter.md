### Procedures
- Perform a Cutting Test
    - To obtain high-quality cutting results, carry out a cutting test to check the cutting quality for the material before you perform the actual cutting.
    - Check that the PEN FORCE slider is in its center setting   
    ![pen-force](/pen-force.png)
    - Hold down `test` key for one second or longer
    - The test pattern is cut

- Cleaning the Machine
    - Items required : Cloth soaked in water and thoroughly wrung out   
        ![clean](/clean.png)
- Cleaning the Blade Holder Cap
    - If there is a buildup of material adhesive or dust inside the cap, loosen the cap, remove it, and remove any foreign matter. If pieces of material or dust build up inside the blade holder cap, the blade will stop turning smoothly and will no longer cut cleanly.

- Cutting in the Same Position Repetitively (Overlap)   
![overlap](/overlap.png)
- Cutting Corners Cleanly (Over Cut) : This function cuts an extra 1 mm at the start and end of each line. It is effective when you want to produce particularly sharp corners, for example when cutting
thicker materials. In most cases the over cut function should be set to "OFF." Set it to ON when you want to ensure that corners are cut cleanly.
