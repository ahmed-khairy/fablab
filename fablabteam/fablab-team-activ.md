    - using freecad to design a pyramid and print it on 3d printer
    - I made the layers that was:
        1. first layer was 5cm width, 5cm length and 1cm height.
        - ![zidan1](zidan1.jpg)

    - Then I grouped them into one shape.
    - After that I saved the project as `stl`.
    - Then used cura application to convert it to `gcode` and saved it in SD card
    - Finally, I put the card in the 3D printer to start print. It takes 1.15 hour to protect this shape.
