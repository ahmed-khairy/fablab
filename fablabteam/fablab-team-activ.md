    - using freecad to design a pyramid and print it on 3d printer
    - I made the layers that was:
        1. first layer was 5cm width, 5cm length and 1cm height.

        2. second layer was 4cm length, 4cm width and 1 cm height.

        5. Last layer was cubic 1\*1\*1.

    - Then I grouped them into one shape.
    - After that I saved the project as `stl`.
    - Then used cura application to convert it to `gcode` and saved it in SD card
    - Finally, I put the card in the 3D printer to start print. It takes 1.15 hour to protect this shape.

- making key chain for the fablab keys
    - first design
        1. I made a rectangle with diminutions 3cm x 5cm that contains `A` letter.
        2. I made 2 circles with diameter 5mm.
        3. I changed the setting of the lines of the triangle and circles to hair line to allow the laser cutter to cut them.
        4. I repeat these steps 7 times, with changing the latter from A to B, C, E, F, G, H and S.

    - second design
        1. I made rectangle with dimentions 30cm*5cm that contains 7 letters and under each letter a circle with diameter 5mm.
        2. I chanced the setting of the lines of the triangle to hair line.
